# Geolocation Dictionary Application

## Description
This dictionary uses your searches and your location to pinpoint where you are searching from and what are the most popular searches in your area. Certain words that you search for will have images to accompany their definition. Words will have sound included in them so that you can hear how the word is pronounced.

## Directions
Input the word you would like to search for the definition of. Then hit the search button, or press enter, and the word's definition should come up. 

You may also search for multiple words in one visit. Your most recent search will go ahead of the first word you attempted to search for. 

## Future Development
Our future developmnet plans are to have more than one definition be shown to the user. Also, to have a top five searches feature for each individiual city to see what people are searching for in that specific area that is popular.
